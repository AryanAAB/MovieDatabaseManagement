# Movie Database Management
This is a Django project that allows an admin to add movies to the website.

The admin can enter details such as the title, director, genre, and the description. He or she can optionally add a poster image as well(a default image of a clapperboard is used if no poster is provided.). Once a movie has been added, users can see the movies on the main page.
